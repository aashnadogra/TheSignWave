## TheSignWave
TheSignWave is a dynamic and interactive tool that allows users to create their own datasets, define custom actions, and train models using neural networks to recognize hand gestures. The trained model can then predict gestures in real-time using a camera feed, making it a versatile solution for applications in sign language interpretation, gesture-based control, and more.
